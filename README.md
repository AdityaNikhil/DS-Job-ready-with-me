# DS-Job-ready-with-me
This is a repo created to getting job ready within the field of Data Science/Machine Learning.

This is an 8 months roadmap to geting placed in the field of DS. 

---

## Background
I am an international student currently studying in Northeastern University pursuing Masters in Applied Machine Intelligence course. I am passionate about data science and have done several projects over the past and even interned at a few organisations.
Being an international student, **I currently have 8 months** from now to landing an internship. Here, I'll be **posting all the resources** I'll be using to landing an internship successfully. 

\**This repo shall serve as my personal preparation journey to getting placed. I hope it helps you too.*\*

## Roadmap
This roadmap shall be starting from covering all the fundamental concepts to core concepts. Along the way, we'll be tackling interesting projects in various sectors(health, finance, ecommerce...) and finally solving interview problems. All the links whatever I use to study shall be posted. 

**Topics covered:** 
1. [SQL & DB Design](#1-sql--db-design)
2. [DSA](#2-dsa)
3. [Probabilty](#3-probability)
4. [Statistics](#4-statistics)
5. [Machine Learning](#5-machine-learning)

\**The roadmap is inspired from **Ace the Data Science Interview** book by Nick Singh and Kevin Huo.*\*

### 1. SQL & DB Design
I am following the [Coursera's SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science) to learn SQL.

\**For free and thorough SQL end to end course, I suggest [Sumit Mittal's SQL playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAOUpVM6R6I&list=PLtgiThe4j67rAoPmnCQmcgLS4iIc5ungg) on Youtube.*\*

**Track 1:** 
  1. What is SQL?
  2. History of data models
  3. Relational vs Transactional Databases
  4. Creating tables 
  5. Retrieving data using Select 
  6. Data modeling and ER diagrams

**Track 2:**
  1. Basics of filtering with SQL
  2. Avanced filtering using IN, AND, OR
  3. USING WILD CARDS IN SQL ("%, _")
  4. Sorting columns using ORDER BY
  5. Grouping data using GROUP BY
  6. Aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT, AVG)

**⭐[Key Takeaways](1.%20SQL%20%26%20DB%20Design/Key_Takeaways.md)**


### 2. DSA
I am studying the DSA following this [roadmap suggested by GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complete-roadmap-to-learn-dsa-from-scratch/).

I found it very intuitive compared to other resources. 

**Day 1**
1. [Time Complexities and Space complexities](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/)
    - [Practice Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-time-complexity-analysis/)

2. [Asymptotic Analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)      
    - Why performance analysis?
    - Is this method feasible?
